# Data-Collection
When there was flooding in 2020 Febuary, for the centre of powys, I have recorded this data for people to easily use to predict whether or not the next predicted levels will flood. I also have made a prediction program that will allow me to see if the house will be at risk from flooding, based on this data.
Current Format of all files is "=" for a new reading and "|" to split the data
